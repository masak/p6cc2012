## Correctness

This one gets the right line lengths by simply finding a last word of lines 2
and 3 with the right length. Not half-bad. Still seems to require a fair bit of
searching, though, because the algorithm simply hopes it gets lucky with
syllables.

The implementation of `syllable` is OK. But it's actually less advanced than
the ones with a `Lingua::EN::Syllable` heritage. And it shows, because it
mis-counts syllables now and then. Example:

    Chelsie talks quiet ship (6)
    Yung does reprehensively (7)
    Werner flaunts fit spice (5)

Turns out in this particular case, the syllable-counter considers "quiet" as
having one syllable, because it bunches together "i" and "e" into one vowel.

## Consistency

Indentation feels a bit confused, notably in the `RandVerb` subroutine.

## Clarity of intent

The nested `gather` blocks make things slightly hard to read... especially as
the inner ones don't really gather up lists, but simply try to find one value.
I hadn't thought of it before, but gathering up what one expects to be just
one value, feels *unintentful*. We're not using the lazy aspects of `gather`,
nor the dynamic aspects, nor the fact that we can collect several values. The
only mitigating circumstance here is that neither Rakudo nor Niecza implements
`leave` yet.

The short-lived variables feel like they could be named better.

## Algorithmic efficiency

On my laptop, this program usually finished between 9 and 15 seconds. It has to
do a bit of searching, but on the good side, that's about all it has to do. So
it can iterate quickly.

## Idiomatic use of Perl 6

Some kind of Perl 5 heritage shows through in the way the `$length` variable is
initialized in the subroutines. I imagine an idiomatic Perl 6 solution wouldn't
involve `@_`, and would simply use `$length = 0` in a parameter list.

## Brevity

Minus the word lists, the script is actually just over a hundred lines tall.
But that's hard to appreciate when the word lists are inlined.
